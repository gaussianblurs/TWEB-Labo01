# TWEB - Project 01 - "TechnoGraphy"

## About

TechnoGraphy is a data visualization app for Github.   
It enables any Github user to visualize detailed and relevant statistics about their activity on Github.   
The app provides an overview of your profile, with global statistics on your activity on Github in the first section, while the second section shows details about the selected repository from the dropdown menu.

The app was designed with simplicity in mind, bringing powerful information to the user with the help of a single click on a button. The interactive graphs were designed to be easily readable, using carefully selected pastel colors. In light of
all this, the key term of TechnoGraphy is "elegance".  

The app is fully responsive, and powered by [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)   
The graphs were generated with [Chart.js]([Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)
